[ACCESS GRANTED]


Welcome, Intruder.  
You stand before Pandora’s Vault—its secrets buried behind layers of 
encryption. Three locks hold the gate shut. Each more complex than the last.
  
These locks are not ordinary. They are written in codes that only the keenest minds can break.  
Crack the first lock, and the second will reveal itself.  
Break them all… and look closer the Vault will surrender its final secret.  

But be warned.  
Every failed attempt tightens security.  
Too many mistakes… and the Vault will remain sealed forever.
