=== DR. ELIAS VEGA - ARCHITECT OF A NEW ERA ===  
STATUS: [MISSING]  
LAST KNOWN RECORD: [REDACTED]  

Dr. Elias Vega was more than a scientist—he was a visionary. The architect of Celestia’s rise, the mind that turned ambition into reality.  

A pioneer in **artificial intelligence, cybernetics, quantum computing, and sustainable city planning**, he revolutionized Celestia’s infrastructure. His breakthroughs in **self-sustaining energy grids, automated transport systems, and neural-interface technology** transformed the city into a beacon of progress.  

His greatest achievements include:  
- **The Quantum Nexus Core**, an advanced computational network that powered Celestia’s seamless automation.  
- **The SkyBridge Initiative**, a revolutionary transit system integrating levitating railways and AI-assisted traffic control.  
- **The Solaris Grid**, a decentralized energy system that made Celestia fully self-sustaining through fusion and solar power.  
- **The Etherlink Protocol**, an ultra-secure, high-speed data transfer system that connected every aspect of the city.  

His principles of limitless innovation and ethical progress shaped an era of prosperity. His work defined the city. His absence changed everything.  

Some say he vanished when Celestia needed him most. Others believe he left behind a failsafe—a way to restore what was lost.
