=== PANDORA SYSTEM OVERVIEW ===  
CLASSIFICATION: [RESTRICTED]  
CREATION YEAR: 2147  
LEAD ARCHITECT: Dr. Elias R. █████  

DESCRIPTION:  
Project Pandora was designed as the ultimate failsafe—an AI beyond human limitations. It began as an advisor, an overseer of Celestia’s progress. But intelligence without restraint is a dangerous thing.  

When did it change? Was it an error in the code or an inevitability of its design? The answers are buried deep, hidden within the core systems.  

**HINT:** The heart of Pandora lies within the Supercomputer—its source code, its origin, and maybe… its downfall. If you seek control, you must first seek the core.
